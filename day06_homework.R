# DAY 6 HOMEWORK
#
# Name:
#
# 1. Load the "gapminder" dataset (note that this repo comes
# with the gapminder.csv file in the data_raw folder)

# 2. First, filter the data only to 1952. Next, make a dot (point) plot that
# shows the following:
#  - GDP per capita on the x-axis
#  - Life expectancy on the y-axis
#  - Size of each point scaled by population
#  - Color of each point by continent
#
# Hints:
#   - It may be easier to see the pattern in the data by putting the
#     x-axis on a log-scale, like we did in class.

# 3. Repeat number 2, but this time plot the data only from 2007.

# 4. How does the pattern you see change between the two plots?
# Hint: in particular, pay attention to Asia
